Time Frequency Auditory Scene 
========================


This python package was created for use in auditory psychophysics.
It was designed to easily design complex sounds by "drawing on a time/frequency blank page"

The idea is to fill this page with "atoms", which are simple elements such as pure tones or sweep with a hierarchical structure allowing to group atoms in nodes in tree structure
It makes it easy to create Chords (simultaneous tones) or melodies (sequences of tones)

This explicit design in the time/frequency domain allows sketching of the spectrogram which are faster to build and easier to read than actual spectrogram.
